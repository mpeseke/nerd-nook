		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<p>As a newbie to the nerd scene, I would like to be able to find like minded individuals who can guide me in the<br>
			right direction of interest while also being able to attend events I am interested and showcase my new skills</p>
		<h1>User Story</h1>
		<p>Anthony is looking for a quick way to meet up with a consistent group of people in the tabletop gaming community. </p>
		<h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Anthony logs onto the NerdNook </li>
			<li>The NerdNook displays a home page with sections divided into interest categories.</li>
