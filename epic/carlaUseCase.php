		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<p>As a newbie to the nerd scene, I would like to be able to find like minded individuals who can guide me in the<br>
			right direction of interest while also being able to attend events I am interested and showcase my new skills</p>
		<h1>User Story</h1>
		<p>Carla’s job keeps her on the go at all times. She will need to be able to have access to the app remotely<br>
			as well as when she is at home. Ideally, Carla would like to be notified when a new event is posted and if<br>
			interested have the ability to show interest without being obligated to attend should she not get answers to<br>
			possible questions and or other obligations she may have.</p>
		<h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Carla logs into nerds nook and is alerted of a new event that has been created for her interest of cosplay.</li>
			<li>Carla marks herself as interested in attending.</li>
			<li>Carla has a few questions before she gets started on her cosplay and post’s her question to the event </li>
			<li> Carla awaits other possible interested parties/users to respond.</li>
			<li>Once Carla is present at the event, Carla will check herself in and earn “points” for attending that will later be used to up her
				reputation with nerds nook and help up her skill level.</li>
			<li>When the event has concluded, the event will no longer
				be active.</li>
		</ul>
