		<!-- Carla's User Story -->
		<h1>User Story</h1>
		<p>As a new nerd, Carla would like to be able to find like minded individuals who can guide me in the<br>
			right direction of interest and also attend specific events.</p>
		<!-- Carla's Use Case-->
		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<p>Carla’s job keeps her on the go at all times. She will need to be able to have access to the app remotely<br>
			as well as when she is at home. Ideally, Carla would like to be notified when a new event is posted and if<br>
			interested have the ability to show interest without being obligated to attend should she not get answers to<br>
			possible questions and or other obligations she may have.</p>
